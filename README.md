continuing to explore neural networks throguh micrograd. learnt about backpropagation. it basically does chain rule from your highschool calculus class. 

#4/30/2023
implemented backpropegation into each operatoin

#5/1/2023
implemented backward function for an expression graph

#5/2/2023
solved a bug where a node is being used for multiple times during back propegation + some grammar issues
