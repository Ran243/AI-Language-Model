learning basics of Neural Networks through Andrej Karpathy's video about micrograd.

#4/28/2023
continuing to explore neural networks throguh micrograd. learnt about backpropagation. it basically does chain rule from your highschool calculus class. 

#4/30/2023
implemented backpropegation into each operatoin

#5/1/2023
implemented backward function for an expression graph

#5/2/2023
solved a bug where a node is being used for multiple times during back propegation + some grammar issues

#5/3/2023
started consuming extra information on the intricacie of neural netowrks

#5/4/2023
learning about gradiant descent.

#5/5/2023
implemented division, exponential, and subtraction function into micrograd. 

#5/6/2023
created a nerual network libary in micrograd

#5/7/2023
createed parameters for each class in the neural network

#5/8/2023
learnt how to do gradient descent optiiation manually (training the network)

#5/9/2023
what are neural nets?
mathmatical expressions, that takes data and takes the parameters of the neural nets followed by a loss function that try to measure the accuracy of the function. this process is repeated through gradiant descent to get the wanted result. 
- more parameters, more power in the neural net

finished micrograd. going to start a new project following along woth Andrej Karpathy's course

#5/11/2023
working on a presenration to show the functionality of micrograd

#5/12/2023
code not functioning as intended. troubleshooting.

#5/13/2033
solved issue i think?
the issue wasnt with code. it had something to do  with my computer

#5/14/2023
spent day with mom. back to work tmr

#5/15/2023
continue to work on presentation

#5/16/2023
new project, contiuning with Andre onto the next level of neural networks

ran tests on micrograd(it works now).
